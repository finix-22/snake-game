# Snake Game

This snake game is a versatile game that can be played on both desktop and mobile devices. It is built using the React framework, which is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

During the development process, I encountered several challenges. One of these challenges involved understanding the significance of data structures, particularly linked lists, while coding in JavaScript. While arrays are commonly used for storing and manipulating data, recognizing the value of other data structures like linked lists can enhance coding proficiency and enable more efficient solutions to certain problems.

If you're interested in exploring the game further, you can access a [live demo](https://snake-game3123.netlify.app/) to experience it firsthand. Alternatively, you can follow these instructions to run the game on your own device:

1. Clone the Git repository: Use the command `git clone [repository URL]` to clone the repository containing the game's source code.

2. Install dependencies: Navigate to the project directory and run the command `npm install` to install all the necessary dependencies for the game.

3. Run the game: Execute the command `npm start` to start the game on your local development server. This command will compile the code and open the game in your default browser.

4. Build the game: If you want to build the game for production, you can run `npm run build`. This command will create an optimized and minified version of the game that can be deployed to a web server or hosted on platforms like GitHub Pages or Netlify.

By following these steps, you should be able to run and experience the snake game on your own device. Enjoy playing!
